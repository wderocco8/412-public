## 1. Select Python Interpreter

By default, VSCode my not assign the correct [Python interpreter](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments) when opening your Django folder.

### What's wrong with default interpreter:
- you must run `pipenv shell` every time you re-open the project in order to use Django-related commands
- **Intellisense** will not work and your code will likely be covered in **warnings** since the interpreter cannot recognize Django imports...

### Solution

1. get pipenv environment path

    ``` bash
    # cd into your `django` directory 
    cd django

    # exctract and COPY the path of the virtual environment
    pipenv --venv
    ```


2. update python interpreter in vscode

   - on mac: pressÂ `cmd+shift+p` (on windows: pressÂ `ctrl+shift+p`)
   - typeÂ "Python: Select Intepreter"
   - chooseÂ "Enter interpreter path..."
   - paste the path fromÂ pipenv --venv

You should only have to complete these stepsÂ once for you given django project!
